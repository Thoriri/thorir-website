summary: Energy-Efficient Artifact Detection Based on a Minimal Number of EEG Channels.
abstract: "In the context of epilepsy monitoring, EEG artifacts are often mistaken for seizures due to their morphological similarity in both amplitude and frequency, making seizure detection systems susceptible to higher false alarm rates. In this work we present the implementation of an artifact detection algorithm based on a minimal number of EEG channels on a parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) embedded platform."
