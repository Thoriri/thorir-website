Hi! I am Thorir, and I am currently a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich under the supervision ofÂ [Prof. Dr. Luca Benini](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/people-a-z/person-detail.luca-benini.html). My research interest is applying Robust and Practical Machine Learning approaches, focusing on a bio-signal analysis taking into account the characteristics and constraints of wearable edge devices and IoT units. A use case that I am currently researching is the usage of bio-signals to detect and forecast seizures, where the bio-signals come from wearable devices and are classified with ML and DL algorithms on the same wearable edge devices.
