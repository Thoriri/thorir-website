abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to monitor epileptic seizures, and standard clinical practice consists of monitoring patients in dedicated epilepsy monitoring units via video surveillance and cumbersome EEG caps. Such a setting is not compatible with long-term tracking under typical living conditions, thereby motivating the development of unobtrusive wearable solutions. However, wearable EEG devices present the challenges of fewer channels, restricted computational capabilities, and lower signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, artifacts presenting morphological similarities to seizures act as major noise sources and can be misinterpreted as seizures. This paper presents a combined seizure and artifacts detection framework targeting wearable EEG devices based on Gradient Boosted Trees. The seizure detector achieves nearly zero false alarms with average sensitivity values of 65.27% for 182 seizures from the CHB-MIT dataset and 57.26% for 25 seizures from the private dataset with no preliminary artifact detection or removal. The artifact detector achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.95% (on the TUH-EEG Artifact Corpus dataset). Integrating artifact and seizure detection significantly reduces false alarmsâ€”up to 96% compared to standalone seizure detection.  Optimized for a Parallel Ultra-Low Power platform, these algorithms enable extended monitoring with a battery lifespan reaching 300 hours. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating artifact detection in wearable epilepsy monitoring devices to limit the number of false positives.
